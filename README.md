# python_map

this is my first python project, i will be updating here as i go through it. 
the projects that will pop up here are from this Udemy course:

i think that the map the instructor is building will show volcanos in the US, but since i am currently almost exactly in the middle of my bachelor degree and beginning to think about my masters, i have decided to mark on the map campuses of universities and colleges, which might interest me in the future.
